So - this is my first post. Created from scratch.

Lets talk about normality in IT. I mean sense of humour, humanity, simplicity. All this stuff seems to be faded away. Recently i had a kinda of audition in one company in Russia, Moscow - it's called Funbox, well, company and vacancy looked fine - but then i clashed on their lead markup engineer. Vasiliy. Well first of all i checked his profile, he seemed kinda strange for me. A guy who wearing some kinda of Budha hat in Russia is unusual, also face features and posts - creepy mix. I thought - God help me - let me fail in my bad expectations. Let him be not a king of nerds. Well, then i checked his task for applying to open position. Hmmm. Task was very non-ordinary - just like a Budha hat on a Russian little nerd. Guys i worked in better companies, they were better because they do not create such nerd-contest, cause let nerds live in their world, it has nothing to do with daily work, with bussiness process. Who taught you to be lead Vasiliy? Who gave you this task? Who are you hiring Vasiliy? Hope you will read this. People spend time on your shitty jouvenile ambitions to be superb. Markup engineer job - doesn't consist of some ridicilous solutions and demands - it consists of ability to stay in touch with technologies, work hard, be helpful, be part of team, and fight with ... what do you think? Strange tasks by a nerdy smartboy? Nope. With daily routine cause markup engineer is a daily routine with some cool solutions.

Anyway i finished task. And got answer - thank you blabla - you're not nerdy enough. Well that's good news anyway, for me. And all above is for you.

I' m disapointed - it's seems like another really extreme opposite side of lazy and innacurate people. Strange Nerds. Just spending time on them..

Peace guys, no offense.
